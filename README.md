I have made an RGB Color Guessing Game where a color is given in the form of "RGB(X, Y, Z)" where X, Y and Z is in the range between 0-255.

The game has two levels - Easy and Hard. In the easy level one has to guess out of 3 different colors, while in the hard level one has to guess out of 6 different colors.

The game starts and you are asked to choose the correct color corresponding to the displayed RGB(X, Y, Z) color. If you choose the correct color then, "Correct :)" message is displayed and you win. Otherwise, "Try Again :)" message is displayed and you have to guess out of one less color.

One can play this game any number of times, selecting any level of his/her choice.

The Tech stack includes - HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML and CSS is used for structure and styling whereas Javascript is used to make the website responsive.
